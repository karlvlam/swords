##Swords Âäç
This is the final project of a course Unix and Script Programming (COMP111) in my year3 (2008) of UST. 
I don't remember why I was so crazy to write this game by Perl with limited Javascript with so little marks..., but it is fun!
The demo was run on the college's SUN (Yes, it becomes Oracle now...) unix server. Apache + perl module works fine.

Those were the days...

Have fun! This is just for fun.

##System requirement:

###Server side:
1. Unix/Unix-like server (the file locking depends on the unix-like sytem)

2. Web server with Perl 5.8 CGI support

###Client side:
1. Web browser with Javascript, xmlHttpRequest support. (IE 5, 6 and Firefox 2.0.0.9 are tested, but the Firefox of Lab2 have bugs =_=)

##For the coding, just 4 files:

swords.html <- html only, starting point of the game
swords.js <- javascript, front end control
server.pl <- perl cgi, as a server, control the game flow
view.pl <- just for fun, a console mode script to view the steps of 4 players ^_^

##for the data, there are 2 directories:

./games/ <- files for games, make sure the cgi user can read/write this directory.
./images/ <- images of the game


##How do I hold the data ?
1. data of each is stored in a file at ./games.
2. the game file name is MD5 hash of "sWoRd" + [game name], which is 32 byte long.
3. the data file will be locked for every request, and unlock it after everything done, so there is ONLY 1 player read/write the file each time.
